# google-result
Recreate Google search results page


The Google result project is a more difficult rendition of the Google homepage project. I did not use the developer tools to come to the dimensions of every element. Instead, I created the layout using Flexbox (for the header), CSS Grid (for the body), table for the related searches box, and a regular box model for the footer by "eyeballing" the dimensions on the official Google result site and then comparing my page versus the aforementioned. Additionally, I have used, and will continue to use, new HTML and CSS elements/attributes to expose myself more to every facet of the two markup languages.

Through this project, I further solidified my knowledge of CSS and HTML. I also gained additional experience working with layouts in both Flexbox and CSS Grid. I wish to further experiment with Flexbox/CSS Grid in future projects.
